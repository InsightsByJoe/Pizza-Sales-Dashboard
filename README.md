# üçï Pizza Sales Dashboard - Excel Analysis üìäüíª

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive **Pizza Sales Dashboard** using **Microsoft Excel** to analyze and visualize pizza sales data. The aim was to provide actionable insights into pizza sales trends, identifying top and bottom sellers, performance by pizza categories, and understanding time-based sales patterns. 

The dashboard enables users to filter and view detailed data on **Pizza Category**, **Order Date**, and **Pizza Size** through interactive slicers, making it easy to explore the dataset. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Total Revenue**, **Total Pizzas Sold**, **Total Orders**, **Average Order Value**, and **Average Pizzas per Order** are displayed prominently.

### Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**:
  - Pivot Tables
  - Slicers

## Process Overview
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Utilized Excel's **Flash Fill** and **Proper Function** to standardize text fields for better consistency.
   - Checked for missing data and corrected errors in key columns such as order details.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Created **Pivot Tables** to summarize key metrics like **Total Orders**, **Total Pizzas Sold**, and **Revenue** by category, date, and size.
   - Generated charts to visualize sales trends, identifying the most and least popular pizzas and time periods with the highest sales.

3. **Interactive Slicers**:
   - Added slicers to filter results by **Pizza Category**, **Order Date**,  **Pizza Size**, and **Timeline** ,allowing users to interact with the data and drill down into specific areas of interest.

4. **Calculations**:
   - **Average Pizzas per Order**: Calculated by dividing the total pizzas sold by the distinct number of orders, using Pivot Tables for aggregation.
   - Other key metrics (Total Revenue, Average Order Value) were calculated and displayed at the top of the dashboard for easy access.

## Findings
From the dashboard analysis, the following insights were discovered:

### 1. **Revenue and Order Insights**:
   - **Total Revenue**: $817,860.05
   - **Total Orders**: 21,350
   - **Average Order Value**: $38.31
   - **Total Pizzas Sold**: 49,574 pizzas
   - **Average Pizzas per Order**: 2.32

### 2. **Time-Based Sales Trends**:
   - **Peak Sales Hours**: The highest sales occurred between **12 PM - 2 PM**. These are critical hours for operational focus and should be targeted for promotions.
   - **Daily Sales Trend**: The summer months, particularly **July and August**, saw the highest revenue generation, indicating a seasonal preference for pizza orders.

### 3. **Top and Bottom Sellers**:
   - **Top 5 Sellers**:
     1. Big_Meat_S
     2. Thai_Chicken_L
     3. Five_Cheese_L
     4. Four_Cheese_L
     5. Classic_Dlx_M
   - These pizzas consistently drive the most sales, and marketing efforts should focus on these best-sellers.
   
   - **Bottom 5 Sellers**:
     1. The_Greek_XXL
     2. Green_Garden_L
     3. Ckn_Alfredo_S
     4. Calabrese_S
     5. Mexicana_S
   - These pizzas underperformed in terms of sales and may need rebranding or promotion.

### 4. **Category Breakdown**:
   - **Category Sales Distribution**: 
     - Chicken-based pizzas dominated the sales, contributing to **35.4%** of total sales, followed by **Classic** (33.5%) and **Veggie** (31.1%).
   - This suggests customer preference leans towards meaty and traditional options.

## Results and Recommendations
- **Optimize Peak Hours**: Focus operational and marketing resources on the peak hours from **12 PM - 2 PM** to maximize sales.
- **Promote Best-Sellers**: Continue to promote the top-selling pizzas like **Big_Meat_S** and **Thai_Chicken_L**. Consider limited-time offers to increase sales further.
- **Improve Low Performers**: Evaluate the low-performing pizzas (e.g., **The_Greek_XXL**). Either reintroduce them with improved recipes or phase them out in favor of better-selling options.
- **Seasonal Marketing**: Plan ahead for peak months like **July and August** to fully capitalize on increased demand. Off-peak periods should have tailored promotions to maintain steady sales.

## Limitations
- **Time Frame**: The data only covers one year of pizza sales, limiting the ability to make long-term forecasts.
- **Data Variables**: Limited demographic data prevents more in-depth customer segmentation analysis.

## Conclusion
The Pizza Sales Dashboard provides clear and actionable insights into pizza sales trends, helping business owners make informed decisions. By focusing on the key trends identified, including time-based sales peaks and category preferences, the business can enhance its operations, promotions, and product offerings.
